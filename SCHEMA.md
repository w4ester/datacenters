## Use Cases

### 1. Sustainability Analysis
Track environmental impact, PUE, renewable energy, water usage, and carbon footprint. **New additions** enable tracking of backup power infrastructure and fossil fuel dependency.

### 2. Investment & Real Estate
Market analysis, construction pipeline, operator trends. **New additions** provide occupancy rates and tenant diversification metrics for investment analysis.

### 3. Network Infrastructure
Connectivity mapping, latency optimization, peering strategy.

### 4. Education Data Sovereignty
Local AI model hosting, student data ownership, cost-effective options for schools. **New additions** help identify facilities with available capacity and tenant-friendly models.

### 5. Operational Intelligence ðŸ†•
**Enabled by new fields:**
- Generator dependency analysis (diesel vs. battery)
- Energy source diversification
- Tenant concentration risk
- Capacity planning and utilization
- Backup power readiness

## Data Collection Strategy

### Tier 1: Publicly Available (Most fields)
- Facility name, location, operator
- Status, capacity, year opened
- Certifications
- Website data

### Tier 2: Industry Reports & Filings
- PUE, renewable energy %
- Major tenants (for public colocation)
- Network connectivity

### Tier 3: Requires Outreach ðŸ”’
- Exact generator counts
- Diesel fuel capacity
- Rack-level occupancy
- Education pricing
- Tenant breakdowns

Many Tier 3 fields may remain null initially but can be populated through:
- Direct facility contact
- RFPs and quotes
- Industry partnerships
- Public permit databases

## Schema Updates

**v1.0** (Initial) - 33 fields
**v2.0** (Current) - 47 fields
- Added: Power & Backup Infrastructure (5)
- Added: Energy Operations (3)
- Added: Tenant & Occupancy Data (6)

## Vision: Educational AI Sovereignty

This schema enables schools to:
1. **Find capacity** - Identify facilities with available racks
2. **Assess readiness** - Verify backup power and reliability
3. **Evaluate costs** - Compare tenant models and pricing
4. **Ensure sovereignty** - Keep student data within geographic boundaries
5. **Plan operations** - Understand energy sources and sustainability

**"Carbon capture for educational data"** - Keeping student-generated data working for students, not corporations.
